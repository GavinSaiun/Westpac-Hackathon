# Westpac-Hackathon
Hello, we are Eastpac.
Our team proposes using QR codes as an alternative to EFTPOS machines for payments in restaurants and general stores. The vibrant local markets offer a sense of community, but enhancing convenience and safety is crucial due to the rampant skimming uses. QR code payments improve on EFTPOS by reducing fraud, preventing poor spending habits, and eliminating extra fees. Not only this, but it is also easy to implement, extremely secure and has an intuitive user interface that is recognisable by all.

When using the QR code app, a camera scans the code, leading to a menu for the restaurant. The customer can then choose their preferred items and type the price, they’d like to pay in the numpad. Payment confirmations appear on both consumer and seller screens. Thus, allowing for a quick and secure wire transfer.

Although logistical and financial challenges have hindered adoption in Australia, QR code payments are prevalent in countries like China and India, proving their efficiency and potential for success.
